1162,I like to play video games and hang out with my friends. What about you? Do you have any hobbies?
1163,I want to start a bakery. I love to bake so I think it would be a good fit for me.
1164,That sounds like a great idea! I love baking as well. What kind of baked goods do you like to make?
1165,I like baking cakes and cookies. I also like to decorate them.
1166,"Yes, I have been baking since I was a child. I love to bake for my family and friends."

1178,"I think it's actually the 4th or so, but I could be wrong."

1180,I hope so too. I don't want her to miss out on a lot of fun.
1181,That's a good way to look at it. Maybe you can take her out to dinner or something to make up for it.
1182,Thank you so much for your kind words. I will try my best to be the best version of myself.

1190,"That's understandable.  Electric cars have been around since the 1950s, so they've been around a long time."
1191,"Yes, they have. I think I would like to get one of the plug-in hybrid cars, like the Tesla Model S."

1201,"I'm sure it is. I've always wanted to volunteer at a no-kill shelter, where they euthanize sick animals."
1202,"Thank you very much, I appreciate it. I'm sure things will turn around for me."
1203,I don't know either. I wonder if there is a genetic component to it.
1204,That's what I was thinking too. I guess I'll have to do some more research.

1422,Thank you! I'm really looking forward to it. It's been on my bucket list for a long time.
1423,I hope so! I've been saving up for it for a while now. I can't wait!
1424,"Thank you so much! I'm sure I will, it's been a long time since I've gone."
1425,"I don't have any pets right now, but I used to have a cat when I was a kid."
1426,That's too bad. Cats are great for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.
1427,"Yes, they are great companions. They are also great for hunting vermin like mice and rats."
1428,"Yes, they're great hunters. They can see in near darkness and can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for humans to hear."
1429,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you cry, if you don't mind me asking?"
1430,"Yes, I did. It was a lot of hard work, but it was worth it in the end."
1431,I love that one too! I think it's one of the best Disney princesses.
1432,"I agree, it's a great movie. It was made in 1939 by Walt Disney Studios."
1433,"Yes, and it was the first Disney animated feature film to be released in the U.S."
1434,"I didn't know that, but I do know that it was directed by Steven Spielberg."
1435,"Yes, it was. He also directed The Little Mermaid, which came out in 1989."
1436,"Oh wow, that's a long time ago. I remember seeing it in theaters when it first came out."
1437,It was the highest grossing animated film of all time at the box office. It's a classic for sure.
1438,I love a good chocolate cup cake with vanilla cream cheese frosting. How about you?
1439,My favorite is a chocolate cake with strawberries and whipped cream. What's your favorite?

2350,"Wow, that's a lot of insects. I don't think I could handle that."
2351,"I agree, it's not healthy at all. It's a form of child abuse."
2352,"I think it should be too, but it's so hard to find a good solution for it."
2353,I agree. Child abuse is a serious issue and should be taken care of as soon as possible.
2354,"Yes, it is very sad. I wish there was something more I could do to help."
2355,It really is. It makes me sad to think about how many kids are left in the world.
2356,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to her about it? Maybe she just doesn't like you.
2357,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?

3054,Me too. I'm glad I didn't have to wake up in the middle of the night.
3055,That's too bad. I'm glad you got it sorted out though. I know how frustrating that can be.
3056,"Yeah, I was pretty upset about it, but I am glad I got it taken care of."

9271,That sounds like a good job to have. I bet you meet a lot of interesting people.
9272,That's cool. I used to be a customer service representative at a call center. It was a lot of fun.
9273,"Yes, I've been there a few times. It's a beautiful place, and the people are very friendly."
9274,"I'm sure it is, it's one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world."
9275,"I hope so too. I've never been to another country before, so I'm really looking forward to it."
9276,"Yes, she is. She has sold more than 350 million albums worldwide."
9277,"Wow, that's a lot of money. What's your favorite song of hers?"
9278,"That's a good one. I think my favorite is ""Baby One More Time"". What's yours?"
9279,"I highly recommend it. It was released in 2010, so it's not that old."
9280,I'll definitely have to give it a listen. I'm always looking for new music to listen to.
9281,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm trying to eat healthier but it's hard."
9282,"It is hard, but it is worth it in the end. What do you like to eat?"
9283,"I eat a lot of fast food, but I try to stay away from processed foods."
9284,I am the same way. I try not to eat fast food at all. It is so unhealthy.
9285,"It really is. I'm trying to eat healthier, but sometimes I just can't help it."
9286,"Yeah, it's really hard. I don't know what to do with myself when I'm hungry."
9287,"I know how you feel. I try to eat healthy, but it's not always easy."
9288,I've never played that one.  Do you have a favorite game?  I like RPG's too.
9289,"I like them too. They were formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2001."
9290,"That's right, they are from Philadelphia. They have released three studio albums."

9292,"I agree, it is a great album. The album was released as a double-platinum in the U.S. and U.K."
9293,"I didn't know that, but it makes sense. The band was formed in 1999."
9294,The Prius Plug-in Hybrid is the most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car sold in the US.
9295,I've never heard of that one. Is it a plug-in hybrid car?
9296,"Yes, it is. It is also the world's most fuel-efficient electric car."
9297,"I'm not sure if it is a plug in or not, but I do know that it is electric."
9298,"I listen to a little bit of everything, but my favorite band is Pink Floyd. What about you?"
9299,I've never heard of them. What genre are they? I like all kinds of music.
9300,They are a rock band. They were formed in 1962 in Liverpool.
9301,I'll have to check them out sometime. Do you have a favorite song by them?

9311,I'm the same way.  I don't like loud music either.
9312,Do you have any hobbies? I like to run. I run 2 miles every day.
9313,Running is a great way to stay in shape.  Do you listen to music while you run?
9314,"Sometimes, but I prefer to listen to classical music when I run. What kind of music do you like?"
9315,I like all kinds of music.  I listen to a lot of classical while I work out.
9316,"Thank you, me too. It's nice to know there are still good people out there."
9317,"I am reading ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" by George R. R. Martin."
9318,I have never heard of that book. I will have to check it out. Science fiction is my favorite genre.
9319,"I will have to check it out. I have never read any of his books, but I have heard good things."
9320,I love zebras too! They are one of the oldest species of domesticated animals.
9321,"I know, they are so cool. I love how they have stripes on their hooves."
9322,Zebras are also known as the black and white striped zebra.
9323,I didn't know that. Do you know why they are called Zebras instead of horses?
9324,"I'm not sure, but I do know that there are more than seventy different species of zebras."
9325,I didn't know that either. I thought they were only in Africa. I guess I learned something new today.
9326,That's awesome! I've always wanted to visit Portugal. I hear it's beautiful there.
9327,"I don't, but I'd love to learn another language. Spanish is the second most spoken language after English, after English."
9328,I'm going to put it in a jewelry box and put it on a necklace.
9329,That's a great idea. I'm sure your grandson will love that. What else do you like to do?

9350,I do! I'm going to the beach with my family. I can't wait!
9351,We are going to Panama City Beach. It's been a long time since we've been there.
9352,I haven't been there since I was a kid.  I hope you have a great time!
9353,Thank you! I'm really looking forward to it. I've never been to a beach before.
9354,"No, but I've always wanted to go. I think it will be a lot of fun."
9355,I hope you have a great time.  The beach is one of my favorite places to be.
9356,"I don't have any pets at the moment, but I used to have a dog when I was a kid."
9357,"They can be, but it's worth it in the end. What kind of pets do you have?"

9369,I'm sure it is. I don't know if I could do it. My husband stays at home with our kids.
9370,It's definitely not for everyone. I'm a stay at home mom because my husband is in the military.
9371,I can't imagine being a stay-at-home mom. How do you do it?
9372,I'm sure it's very rewarding to provide for your family. How long have you been a SAHM?
9373,That's great! What kind of business are you going to start? I hope it works out for you.

9383,You're welcome. Thank you very much for the well wishes and good luck with your future endeavors.
9384,"Thank you, I appreciate it so much. I hope you have a great rest of your day!"
9385,I agree. It's not good to have a fear of the dark. I don't like it at all.
9386,I do not like the dark either. I like to sleep with the lights on.
9387,That's a good idea. I think I'll try that next time I go to sleep.
9388,I do that too.  It helps me sleep.  I also like to watch the stars at night.

9400,"I have heard of it, but I have never tried it. It sounds good though."
9401,I have a 1985 Chevrolet Camaro. I love it!
9402,I don't have many hobbies. I spend most of my time with my family. How about you?
9403,I spend a lot of time outdoors.  I love to hike and camp.  What do you like to do with your family?

9416,"I'm not sure, but I do know that it was first written in the 10th century."
9417,I wonder if it was a book of poetry or a fiction. I would love to read it.
9418,I love to play baseball.  It is one of my favorite things to do in my spare time.
9419,I play in the Major League Baseball League.  I play for the Philadelphia Yankees.
9420,That's awesome! I'm a big baseball fan. I love the fact that it is played on a rectangular field with nine innings.
9421,"I love it too.  The game is played between two teams of nine players each, and the batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher."
9422,"Just for fun.  I'm not very good at it, but I enjoy watching it."
9423,I can imagine. I would have felt the same way if I was in your shoes.
9424,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get over it.
9425,I hope so too. I'm going to have to find a new place to eat at.

9486,That's too bad. Do you live near a beach or a lake or ocean?
9487,"I live right on the Gulf of Mexico, so there are plenty of beaches here."
9488,"I love the ocean, but I don't get to go as often as I'd like."

11774,"Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do if that happened to me. I'd be so afraid."

11790,"Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you. I hope you don't have to go through that again."

13914,I know what you mean. It's hard to know what to do in those situations.

13943,"I know a lot of people who do it for health or environmental reasons, but I just don't see the point of it."

13945,Me too! It's a great way to exercise and it's fun to be in the water.
