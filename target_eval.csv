14301,I've never heard of that one. I'll have to look it up. My favorite is the red one.
14302,I like to go to the beach and listen to the waves crash on the shore. How about you?

14311,I like my steak pan fried. It's so juicy and tender. How about you?
14312,I like mine flame broiled. I like to grill my steaks on the grill.
14313,That's a good way to do it. Do you grill them on a grill or in an oven?
14314,"I like them pan-fried, but I also like them barbecued."
14315,I prefer them pan fried as well. It's a lot easier to cook them that way.
14316,"I agree. I like them flame broiled as well, but it's hard to get them crispy on the grill."
14317,"Yes, that's true. I usually pan fry them on a grill or in an oven."

14343,It was a presentation on the importance of teamwork and teamwork. I felt so bad about it.
14344,"Thank you so much for your kind words, it means a lot to me to know that."
14345,I'm glad I could help. I hope you have a great rest of your evening.
14346,"I like all kinds of music, but my favorite is jazz. What about you?"
14347,I can see where you're coming from. He's a bit over the top sometimes.

14377,I do too. I just wish it would cool down a bit so I could go swimming.
14378,Swimming is a great way to cool off. I like to go to the beach.
14379,"I wish I had a beach nearby, but I live in a rural area."
14380,"I know, I just don't have a lot of time for it. I work a lot."
14381,I like online shopping too.  It's so convenient.  Do you have a favorite store?
14382,"I know, right? And you don't even have to leave the house to go to the store!"

14399,You're welcome. I'm sure you'll do great. What's your favorite thing to bake?

14414,I wish you the best of luck. I'm sure you will get through it with time.
14415,How long have you been waitressing? What kind of cafes do you work at?

14443,"I don't have any, but I would love to have a dog or a cat. What about you?"
14444,"I would like a dog, but my apartment doesn't allow pets. I think a cat would be a lot easier to take care of."
14445,I agree. Cats are easier to care for than dogs because they don't need as much attention as a dog.
14446,"Yes, I think so too.  Cats can see in near darkness, so I think they would be good at seeing in the dark."
14447,"That's true, they can see so well in darkness. I think that would be a great idea."
14448,"I'm still in high school, so I don't have a job yet, but I hope to get one soon."

14490,That sounds like a good job to have. Do you get to talk to a lot of people?

14492,That sounds like a good job to have. I bet you meet a lot of interesting people.
14493,I studied a lot and practiced a lot. I also practiced martial arts.

14632,"I like a lot of Mexican street food, like tamales and enchiladas."

14649,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find ways to make up for it.
14650,"Thank you. It is hard, but I know I can do it. Do you have any dietary restrictions?"
14651,"Not really, I just try to eat as healthy as I can. I don't eat red meat, poultry, or seafood."
14652,I am the same way. I try to stay away from processed foods as much as possible.
14653,"Yeah, I try not to eat too much processed food, but it's hard sometimes."

15368,That sounds like a lot of hard work. How long have you been doing it for?
15369,"For about a year now. It's been a long road, but I'm getting there."
15370,I'm doing body weight exercises. I'm trying to build muscle so I don't get too fat.
15371,"Yes, I do. I try to go to the gym at least 3 times a week."
15372,"Yes, it is. I love animals so much that I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up."
15373,I like to go to the gym and lift weights.  It's a lot of fun.
15374,That sounds like a good way to stay in shape. Do you have a gym membership?
15375,I'm glad to hear that. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
15376,I'm not a big fan of mozzerella but I do like parmesan.
15377,Parmesan is good too. I like to put it on sandwiches and burgers.
15378,"I've never had it on a hamburger, but I bet it would be good on a cheeseburger."
15379,You should try it sometime. It's a great condiment to put on a burger.
15380,"Yes, I love them. I like mine with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and ketchup. What about you?"
15381,"I haven't, but I've heard a lot about him. He's one of the best-selling authors of all time."

15391,I try to go to as many as I can. The last concert I went to was with a friend of mine.
15392,"That's awesome! I've never been to a concert before, but I'd love to one day."
15393,I highly recommend it. It's a great way to get out of the house and meet new people.
15394,I'll have to check it out sometime. What kind of music do they play?

15404,I love eating out as well. It's hard to find a good restaurant where I live.
15405,Where do you live? I live in a rural area so it's hard for me to find good restaurants.
15406,I'm in the suburbs. There are a lot of fast food restaurants around here.
15407,Do you ever go to restaurants that specialize in fast food? Like Burger King?
15408,"I've never been to a burger king, but I've heard they're pretty good. What's your favorite fast food place?"
15409,I really like In-n-Or-Burger. It's a fast food chain that was founded in 1940 by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

15455,I hope so too. It would be nice to get away from the city for a bit.
15456,I have never been to any of the big cities. I would like to go to New York City one day.
15457,"Thank you, that means a lot to me. I hope you find something you love too."

15468,That's great to hear! I hope I don't have any major injuries in the future.
15469,That's unfortunate. I'm sorry you had to go through that. How long were you together?
15470,"You're welcome. I know it's hard, but you'll get through it. I wish you the best."

15472,It really is. It's the most populous city in the state of Illinois.
15473,"That's good to know, I'll have to check it out one day. I know it's the third-largest metropolitan area in the United States."
15474,"Wow, that's a lot of people. I'm surprised it's not bigger than New York City or Los Angeles."
15475,"I didn't know that, but I guess it makes sense since it's the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world."
15476,It's also the most densely populated metropolitan area in the United States.
15477,I love blue too. It's so calming to look at. What do you like to paint?
